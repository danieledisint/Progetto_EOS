# Projects

The project assignment for 2026 focuses on the development of new scheduling algorithms for FreeRTOS


## 🕒 Project 1 — Precise Scheduler for FreeRTOS

> A deterministic, timeline-driven scheduler replacing the default FreeRTOS priority-based model.

### 📘 Table of Contents

### 🧭 Overview

This project aims to **develop a precise, timeline-based scheduler** that **replaces the standard priority-based FreeRTOS scheduler**.
The scheduler enforces **deterministic task execution** based on a **major frame and sub-frame structure**, following the principles of **time-triggered architectures**.

Each task runs at **predefined times** in a global schedule, ensuring predictable real-time behavior and repeatability — without relying on dynamic priority changes.

### ⚙️ Key Features

#### **1. Major Frame Structure**
- The scheduler operates within a **major frame**, with a duration **defined at compile time** (e.g., 100 ms, 1 s).
- Each major frame is divided into **sub-frames**, smaller time windows that host groups of tasks.
- Each sub-frame can **contain multiple tasks** with assigned timing and order.

**Example**

```
Major frame = 100 ms
Sub-frames = 10 × 10 ms
→ The scheduler repeats this 100-ms timeline cyclically.
```

#### **2. Task Model**
- Each task is implemented as a **single function** that executes from start to end and then terminates.
- Tasks do **not** include periodicity or self-rescheduling logic — the scheduler controls activation timing.
- If two tasks need to communicate, they do it through polling

#### **3. Task Categories**

##### 🧱 Hard Real-Time (HRT) Tasks
- Assigned to a specific sub-frame.
- The scheduler knows the **start time** and **end times** of each task within the sub-frame.
- A task is **spawned at the beginning** of its slot and either:
  - runs until completion, or
  - is **terminated** if it exceeds its deadline.
- **Non-preemptive:** once started, it cannot be interrupted.

**Example**

```
Task_A → Sub-frame 2 (20–30 ms)
Start = 21 ms, End = 27 ms
→ Finishes at 26 ms → OK
→ Still running at 27 ms → Terminated
```

##### 🌿 Soft Real-Time (SRT) Tasks
- Executed **during idle time** left by HRT tasks.
- Scheduled in a **fixed compile-time order** (e.g., Task_X → Task_Y → Task_Z).
- **Preemptible** by any hard real-time task.
- **No guarantee** of completion within the frame.

**Example**

```
Sub-frame 5 (40–50 ms)
Task_B (HRT) uses 4 ms → Remaining 6 ms used by SRT tasks (Task_X → Task_Y → Task_Z)
```


#### **4. Periodic Repetition**
- At the end of each major frame:
  - All tasks are **reset and reinitialized**. This can be done by destroying and recreating all tasks or by resetting their state to an initial value.
  - The scheduler **replays the same timeline**, guaranteeing deterministic repetition across frames.

#### **5. Configuration Interface**

All scheduling parameters (start/end time, sub-frame, order, category, etc.) are defined in a **dedicated OS data structure**.

**Example**

```c
typedef struct {
    const char* task_name;
    TaskFunction_t function;
    TaskType_t type; // HARD_RT or SOFT_RT
    uint32_t ulStart_time;
    uint32_t ulEnd_time;
    uint32_t ulSubframe_id;
} TimelineTaskConfig_t;
```
Selecting the most suitable structure to represent all tasks is a key part of the project assignment.

A system call (e.g. `vConfigureScheduler(TimelineConfig_t *cfg)`) will:
- Parse this configuration,
- Create required FreeRTOS data structures,
- Initialize the timeline-based scheduling environment.

# Assignment for all projects

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Release jitter:** ≤ 1 tick.
- **Overhead:** ≤ 10% CPU (≤8 tasks).
- **Portability:** QEMU Cortex-M.
- **Thread safety:** use FreeRTOS-safe synchronization.
- **Documentation:** clear API and timing model.
- **Codign guidelines** strictly follow freeRTOS coding guidelines.

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

Handle all errors with dedicated hook functions following the FreeRTOS style.

## Trace and Monitoring System
A **trace module** must be developed for test and validation purposes to log and visualize scheduler behavior with **tick-level precision**.

### Logged information:
- Task start and end ticks
- Deadline misses or forced terminations
- CPU idle time

**Example Output**

```
[ 21 ms ] Task_A start
[ 26 ms ] Task_A end
[ 40 ms ] Task_B start
[ 47 ms ] Task_B deadline miss → terminated
```

```
[   0] A RELEASE
[   0] A START
[   5] A COMPLETE
[  10] A RELEASE
[  10] B RELEASE
[  10] A START
[  12] B START
[  25] B DEADLINE_MISS (D=15 @ tick 25)
[  30] A OVERRUN → SKIP
[  40] A RELEASE
...
```

## Production and Regression Testing
Develop an **automated test suite** to validate the scheduler's correctness and robustness.

### The suite must include:
- Stress tests (e.g., overlapping HRT tasks).
- Edge-case tests (e.g., minimal time gaps).
- Preemption and timing consistency checks.

Each test must:
- Produce **human-readable summaries**, and
- Include **automatic pass/fail checks** for regression testing.

**Example**

```
Test 3 – Overlapping HRT Tasks: FAILED (Task_A killed at 32 ms)
Test 4 – SRT Preemption: PASSED
```

## Configuration framework (optional)

Create a high-level configuration framework (e.g., a Python script) that enables the user to describe the target problem, perform schedulability analysis (for algorithms that support it), and ultimately generate the FreeRTOS skeleton application.

## 📦 Deliverables
1. ✅ Modified FreeRTOS kernel with timeline-based scheduler.
2. ✅ Configuration data structure and system call for schedule definition.
3. ✅ Trace and monitoring system with tick-level resolution.
4. ✅ Automated test suite for validation and regression checking.
5. ✅ Documentation and example configurations.


## 🕒 Development Tools and Licenses

It is mandatory to use GitLab for all development purposes. A GitLab account for each group member will be created soon. You will receive an email with credentials.

Every file must be released following the FreeRTOS license schema.
